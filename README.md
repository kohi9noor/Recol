# Recol

Recol is a simple keyboard-focused tool to help you save and find your links without breaking your flow. It's built for people who find browser bookmarks slow or messy.

## How it works

- **Save instantly**: Tap a shortcut and save what you're looking at. No clicking around.
- **Find everything**: Search through your saved links with a fast search that actually understands what you're looking for.
- **Stay in the zone**: Designed to be used entirely with your keyboard so you don't have to reach for the mouse.

## Shortcuts

- `Shift + CMD + S` (Mac) / `Shift + CTRL + S` (Windows): Save the current page.
- `Shift + CMD + L` (Mac) / `Shift + CTRL + L` (Windows): Search your links.
- `Arrows` & `Enter`: Move through results and open them.

## Setup

2. Unzip the file.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder you just unzipped.
