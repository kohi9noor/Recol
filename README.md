# Recol

Recol is a simple tool to save and find links using just your keyboard. If you're tired of browser bookmarks being slow or requiring too much clicking, this is for you.

### What you can do:

- **Save links fast**: Use a shortcut to save whatever page you're on instantly.
- **Find things quickly**: A quick search that actually helps you find what you saved.
- **No mouse needed**: Everything works with shortcuts so you can stay focused.

### The Shortcuts:

- **Save page**: `Shift + CMD + S` (Mac) or `Shift + CTRL + S` (Windows)
- **Search links**: `Shift + CMD + L` (Mac) or `Shift + CTRL + L` (Windows)
- **Navigate**: Use the arrow keys to move and `Enter` to open.

### Getting Started:

1. [Download the latest version here](download.md).
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** in the top right.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the folder you unzipped.

That's it. Simple.
