# Get the Extension

### 1. Download

[Click here to download the zip file](release/crx-recol-1.0.0.zip?raw=true)

### 2. Unzip

Once it's downloaded, find the file `crx-recol-1.0.0.zip` and unzip it. This will give you a folder with everything the extension needs.

### 3. Load it into Chrome

1. Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (the switch in the top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** (top left).
4. Select the folder you just unzipped.

That's it. You're ready to go. You can find your shortcuts in the [main guide](README.md).
